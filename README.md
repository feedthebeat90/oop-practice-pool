# oop-practice-pool
This repository contains the source code for 50 Object-Oriented Programming coding exercises.

The code is written in YAML syntax, because DataCamp's Teach Editor uses YAML while building Practice Pools as GitHub repositories. However, the objective of this 50 challenges is to present the user with several practical and conceptual Python exercises for them to solidify the learning objectives taught on DataCamp's "Object-Oriented Programming in Python" course.
