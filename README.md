# oop-practice-pool
This repository contains the source code for 50 Object-Oriented Programming coding exercises.

The code is written with YAML syntax, because DataCamp's Teach Editor uses YAML while building Practice Pools as GitHub repositories. However, the objective of this 50 challenges is to present the user with several practical and conceptual exercises for them to practice the learning objectives of DataCamp's "Object-Oriented Programming in Python" course.
